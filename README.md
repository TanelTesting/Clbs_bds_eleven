The test runs fine, BUT whenever I want to add dependency for Allure, the test becomes not runnable. 
Good advice is appreciated. 

Technology / tool stack: java, Selenide, TestNG, Allure Report

Test scenario:
1) open google.com
2) search for "imdb"
3) click on correct search result that redirects to imdb.com
4) click on Menu button
5) click on "Born Today"
6) print out 5 first celebrities who are born today
